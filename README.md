# Ricochet Royale

## Overview
Ricochet Royale is a local four-player party brawler built around ricocheting projectiles and bouncy character physics. Players navigate obstacles-strewn arenas, throwing and ricocheting projectiles to outplay opponents.

The game is built around a finite state machine (FSM) architecture for player behavior, enabling clean transitions between movement, attacking, hit reactions, and death. It supports controller input, making it easy to play locally with friends.

This project is now archived and documented as part of my technical game development portfolio.
